docker-wagtail-develop
======================


A script to painlessly set up a Docker environment for development of Wagtail - inspired by [vagrant-wagtail-develop](https://github.com/wagtail/vagrant-wagtail-develop)

Initial work in Bristol sprint January 2020 by [esperk](https://github.com/esperk) and [saevarom](https://github.com/saevarom).

Setup
-----

**Requirements:** [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and Docker Compose (Docker Compose is included with Docker Desktop for Mac and Windows).

Open a terminal and follow those instructions:

```sh
# 1. Decide where to put the project. We use "~/Development" in our examples.
cd ~/Development
# 2. Clone the docker-wagtail-develop repository in a new "wagtail-dev" folder.
git clone https://github.com/wagtail/docker-wagtail-develop.git wagtail-dev
# 3. Move inside the new folder.
cd wagtail-dev/
# 4. Run the setup script. This will check out the bakerydemo project and local copies of wagtail and its dependencies.
./setup.sh
# 5. Build the containers
docker-compose build
```

It can take a while (typically 15-20 minutes) to fetch and build all dependencies and containers.

Here is the resulting folder structure:

```sh
.
├── libs          # Supporting libraries to develop Wagtail against.
├── wagtail       # Wagtail repository / codebase.
└── bakerydemo    # Wagtail Bakery project used for development.
```

Once the build is complete:

```sh
# 6. Start your containers and wait for them to finish their startup scripts.
docker-compose up
```
You might see a message like this the first time you run your containers. This is normal because the frontend container has not finished building the assets for the Wagtail admin. Just wait a few seconds for the frontend container to finish building (you should see a message like `webpack compiled successfully in 15557 ms` and then stop and start your containers again (Ctrl+C + `docker-compose up`).
```
WARNINGS:
?: (wagtailadmin.W001) CSS for the Wagtail admin is missing
	HINT:
            Most likely you are running a development (non-packaged) copy of
            Wagtail and have not built the static assets -
            see https://docs.wagtail.org/en/latest/contributing/developing.html

            File not found: /code/wagtail/wagtail/admin/static/wagtailadmin/css/normalize.css```

```

```sh
# 7. Now in a new shell, run the databse setup script. The database will be persisted across container executions by Docker's Volumes system so you will only need to run this commmand the first time you start the database.
./setup-db.sh
# Success!
```

If you're running this on Linux you might get into some privilege issues that can be solved using this command (tested on Ubuntu):
```sh
CURRENT_UID=$(id -u):$(id -g) docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.linux.yml up
```

Alternatively, if you're using VSCode and have the "Remote - Containers" extension, you can open the command palette and select "Remote Containers - Reopen in Container" to attach VSCode to the container. This allows for much deeper debugging.

- Visit your site at http://localhost:8000
- The admin interface is at http://localhost:8000/admin/ - log in with `admin` / `changeme`.

What you can do
---------------

### See a list of running containers

```sh
$ docker-compose ps
  Name                Command               State           Ports
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
db         docker-entrypoint.sh postgres    Up          5432/tcp
frontend   docker-entrypoint.sh /bin/ ...   Up
web        ./manage.py runserver 0.0. ...   Up          0.0.0.0:8000->8000/tcp
```

### Build the backend Docker image
```sh
make build
```
or
```sh
docker-compose build web
```

### Bring the backend Docker container up

```sh
make start
```
or
```sh
docker-compose up
```

### Stop all Docker containers

```sh
make stop
```
or
```sh
docker-compose stop
```
### Stop all and remove all Docker containers

```sh
make down
```
or
```sh
docker-compose down
```
	
### Run tests

```sh
make test
```
or
```sh
docker-compose exec -w /code/wagtail web python runtests.py
```

### Run tests for a specific file

```sh
make test file=wagtail.admin.tests.test_name.py
```
or
```sh
docker-compose exec -w /code/wagtail web python runtests.py wagtail.admin.tests.{test_file_name_here}.py
```

### Open a Django shell session

```sh
make ssh-shell
```
or
```sh
docker-compose exec web python manage.py shell
```

### Open a PostgreSQL shell session

```sh
make ssh-db
```
or
```sh
docker-compose exec web python manage.py dbshell
```
### Open a shell on the web server

```sh
make ssh
```
or
```sh
docker-compose exec web bash
```

### Open a shell to work with the frontend code (Node/NPM)

```sh
make ssh-fe
```
or
```sh
docker-compose exec frontend bash
```

### Open a shell to work within the wagtail container

```sh
make ssh-fe
```
or
```sh
docker-compose exec -w /code/wagtail web bash
```

### Make migrations to the wagtail bakery site

```sh
make migrations
```
or
```sh
docker-compose exec web python manage.py makemigrations
```

### Migrate the wagtail bakery site

```sh
make migrate
```
or
```sh
docker-compose exec web python manage.py migrate
```

Getting ready to contribute
---------------------------

Here are other actions you will likely need to do to make your first contribution to Wagtail.

Set up git remotes to Wagtail forks (run these lines outside of the Docker instances, on your machine):

```sh
cd ~/Development/wagtail-dev/wagtail
# Change the default origin remote to point to your fork.
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:<USERNAME>/wagtail.git
# Add wagtail/wagtail as the "upstream" remote.
git remote add upstream git@github.com:wagtail/wagtail.git
# Pull latest changes from all remotes / forks.
git pull --all
```

Contributing to Willow and other Wagtail dependencies
-----------------------------------------------------

You can use the same setup to contribute to Willow and other Wagtail dependencies.
You simply do the same operations to fork the Willow project and point your local copy of Willow to your fork.

You can add dependencies by cloning the repository into the `libs` folder and then rebuild your container.
The Dockerfile should pick up your library and install it from the local source.

TODO
----

* Set up an elasticsearch service container
* Test on Windows and Linux
